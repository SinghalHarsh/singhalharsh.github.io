::: {.text-end}
Jan 2021 - Present
:::
:::
- Used settlement data to predict the probability of failure of any trade
  * Built model using CatBoost and inspected SHAP values to generate commentary on top reasons
for trade failure; created a Plotly dashboard for backtesting
  * Used SMOTE to handle imbalanced classes along with K-fold target encoding of high-cardinality
categorical variables to achieve an 0.9 AUC, 60% precision, and 58% recall
- Semi-automated the matching process of inbound payments
  * Developed a multi-class random forest model to improve the matching process of inbound pay-
ments, saving $200M per year
  * Used TFIDF method to extract features from raw text data to achieve an accuracy of 80%

:::
- Systematically captured and explained drivers of Unencumbered Securities worth $15B
  * Created attributes for clustering like stickiness, persistence among other behavioral features
  * Explored K-means, DBSCAN and hierarchical clustering; used silhouette score and CH-index to optimize the number of clusters
- Built a tool to automate the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process
  * Key features include descriptive statistics, variable associations, target variable characteristics, basic data quality checks, and missing value analysis

:::
- Developed a framework for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of a newspaper
  * Created a digitization workflow that segments the entire newspaper image at the article level and extracts the text from each segment.
- Offline Signature Verification using Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  * Built a model on top of the VGG16 architecture and trained it with transfer learning on the ICDAR SigComp dataset to achieve a 70% accuracy and a 14% false acceptance rate
